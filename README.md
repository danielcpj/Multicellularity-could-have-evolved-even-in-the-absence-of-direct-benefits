## Instructions

1. Unzip `Data.zip` before running any code.

2. This repository contains two types of scripts:
   - Data-generation scripts, which produce the data in the `Data.zip` folder.
   - Figure-generation scripts, which generate the figures used in the main paper.  
     These scripts are named after the figures they produce.
